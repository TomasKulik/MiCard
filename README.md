# MiCard

Learning Flutter and dart at appbrewery.co

Mi Card should have been a personal business card but I made something not that representative.

During this project a was thought:

* How to create Stateless Widgets
* What is the difference between hot reload and hot refresh and running an app from cold
* How to use Containers to lay out UI
* How to use Columns and Rows to position UI elements
* How to add custom fonts
* How to add Material icons
* How to style Text widgets
* How to read and use Flutter Documentation
